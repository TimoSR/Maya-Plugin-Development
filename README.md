# Maya-Plugin-Development
Plugins designed to ease the development process of 3D models and animation for game developers.

The tools a created to people with an understanding of the maya software, I'll therefore suggest running the examples with me at the exam.

## Exam Proposal
This project is a solo project, as it takes interest in my future internship. My project will focus on
developing/learning to program tools to ease the production of 3D models for real time-visual
effects and mesh animation for games with Maya. Maya is known to be complicated software to
use compared to software like 3ds Max and Blender but can produce more complicated tools to
optimize production. Python is a great tool in 3D as it works across DCC's (Digital Content
Creation Tools), and is used throughout the whole VFX industry.
Project overview:

* Creating tool scripts for Maya.
* The project requirements will follow the standard set by the vfxplatform.com.
* Creating QT UI to handle the tool scripts within Maya.
* Iâ€™ll be Looking into the following libraries for the python project:
  * QT (https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python)
  * PySide 2 (https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/)
  * Maya Python API
* The challenge in this project will be in handling the advanced mesh data, to automate
part of the production/animation/UVing process of meshes, that is optimized for game
engines, and enabling this to the user in an easy to use interface.
The scope of the project may vary, as the requirements for the project will be discovered
throughout the project, and as time permits.
To get an insight into the RTVFX community I will refer to realtimevfx.com.

## The Completed Project

A completed retimer tool for animation & prototype of procedural modeling script.

The retimer tool is used automate lot of the manual work that needs to be done in an animation. With a tool like this you can get your animation to feel just right. The tool utilizes the Maya timeline data, reading the keyframes creating accesspoints through an easy to use interface. To use this tool, you are required to have a keyframes to edit, therefore I have created an animation example that can be used.  

The procedural modeling script is bonus project i did to showcase how to can receive mesh data from maya, and create simple mesh shapes in an easier way.
