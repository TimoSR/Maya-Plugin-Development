# Maya-Plugin-Development
Plugins designed to ease the development process of 3D models and animation for game developers.

## Exam Proposal
This project is a solo project, as it takes interest in my future internship. My project will focus on
developing/learning to program tools to ease the production of 3D models for real time-visual
effects and mesh animation for games with Maya. Maya is known to be complicated software to
use compared to software like 3ds Max and Blender but can produce more complicated tools to
optimize production. Python is a great tool in 3D as it works across DCC's (Digital Content
Creation Tools), and is used throughout the whole VFX industry.
Project overview:

* Creating tool scripts for Maya.
* The project requirements will follow the standard set by the vfxplatform.com.
* Creating QT UI to handle the tool scripts within Maya.
* Iâ€™ll be Looking into the following libraries for the python project:
  * QT (https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python)
  * PySide 2 (https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/)
  * Maya Python API
* The challenge in this project will be in handling the advanced mesh data, to automate
part of the production/animation/UVing process of meshes, that is optimized for game
engines, and enabling this to the user in an easy to use interface.
The scope of the project may vary, as the requirements for the project will be discovered
throughout the project, and as time permits.
To get an insight into the RTVFX community I will refer to realtimevfx.com.
